# Getting the project to work

## Cloning the Repository from GitLab:

- Go to your project on GitLab.
- Copy the repository URL.
- In the Git Bash, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

## Creating and Switching to a New Branch:

- Inside the cloned repository, run:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b new_branch_name
    ```

# Basic Git Commands:

- **Adding Changes:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    - Explanation: This command stages all changes in the working directory for the next commit.

- **Committing Changes:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

    - Explanation: This command records changes to the repository along with a descriptive commit message.

- **Switching Branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout target_branch_name
    ```

    - Explanation: This command switches to the specified branch.

- **Pushing Changes:**

    ```bash
    git push origin new_branch_name
    ```

    - Explanation: This command pushes committed changes to a remote repository (origin) on the specified branch.

- **Pulling Changes:**

    ```bash
    git pull origin target_branch_name
    ```

    - Explanation: This command fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

- **Fetching Changes:**

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```

    - Explanation: This command fetches changes from a remote repository without merging them into the current branch.

# Basic workflow in gitlab

## Development stage

- **Checkout Main Branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

    - Explanation: This command switches to the main branch, the default protected branch.

- **Create New Branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature_branch
    ```

    - Explanation: This command creates and switches to a new branch (e.g., feature_branch) for your changes.

    - Note: In some workflows or platforms like ClickUp, branches may be automatically generated by actions like starting a new task.

- **Commit New Changes:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of changes"
    ```

    - Explanation: Stage and commit your changes to the new branch.

- **Push Changes to Remote:**

    ```bash
    git push origin feature_branch
    ```

    - Explanation: Push your local changes to the remote repository.

- **Create a Merge Request:**

    - Go to your GitLab project or GitHub repository.
    - Find the option to create a new merge request.
    - Choose the main branch as the target and your feature branch as the source.
    - Provide a title and description for your merge request.

- **Assign Reviewer and Assignee:**

    - Assign your teacher as the reviewer.
    - Assign your teacher as the assignee if the task is complete.

## Code Review Process:

- The reviewer (teacher) will receive a notification about the merge request.

- The reviewer can:
    - Add comments to specific lines of code.
    - Request changes if modifications are needed.
    - Approve the merge request if everything looks good.

- You (the author) can address comments and make changes.

- The reviewer can re-review the changes.

- Once approved, the merge request can be merged into the main branch.

- The status of the merge request may include:
    - Comments: Feedback on specific lines of code.
    - Request Changes: Additional modifications are needed.
    - Approve: The changes are acceptable for merging.

This process helps ensure that code changes are reviewed and approved before being merged into the protected main branch.

# Pass-Fail Exercise 

To pass this exercise install all the required software, create gitlab account and ask for access to repository. Then in directory `student` create your own directory matching the pattern and place in it a simple `readme.md` file. Create a proper merge request. When it would be approved and merged into main branch, the exercise in considered `Passed`
