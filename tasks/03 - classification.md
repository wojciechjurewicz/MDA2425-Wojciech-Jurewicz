In project we would works a little different now

* Check you if you have access to clickup
* First job would be to create the task that must be done for the project to succeed
* Those task must be defined on clickup (a proper groups shall be arranged)
* You should create branches - project_n-team_n-develop - those would be the main branches for the project
* create directory in project directory to store notebooks of you solution.
* for libraries you should be using src dir but you may create you own files.
