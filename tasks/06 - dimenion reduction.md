In this project you would be using dataset from previous projects. 

You are allowed to use code of the previous groups.

Your job is to extend the previous analysis by applying data reduction methods.

1. Perform decompossition with PCA, LDA, FA or CA if applicable if given case
2. Visualise the energy associated with each decompossition
3. Visualise the main components
4. Check the behaviour of the model in train-test-split environment
5. Build up a classification/regression models that uses pricipal/factor components
6. Compare to efficiency with original top-performer.
